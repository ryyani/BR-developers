      <p>Test cricket is the longest and oldest type of international cricket. The first officially<br>
         recognized Test match took place  on 15-19 March 1877 and was played between England and Australia<br>
          at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where Australia won by 45 runs.</p>

      <p>One-Day International (ODI) cricket, a format renowned for its brevity and excitement, has etched a prominent place <br>
        in the world of cricket. Its origins can be traced back to the mid-20th century when cricketing nations sought to bring the<br>
         game closer to spectators by condensing it into a single day's play. 

        The genesis of ODI cricket can be attributed to a need for innovation in the sport. The first official ODI match took place<br>
         on January 5, 1971, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia. It featured Australia and England, marking the inception<br>
          of a format that would capture the imagination of cricket fans worldwide.
        
        The impetus behind the creation of ODI cricket was a desire to provide a more spectator-friendly version of the game.<br>
         In traditional Test cricket, matches could span five days, making it inaccessible to a broader audience. <br>
         ODI cricket, with its concise format, allowed fans to witness an entire game in a single day.</p>
      
<h3>T20</h3>

<p>
Twenty20 (T20) is a shortened format of cricket. At the professional level, it was introduced by the <br>
    England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 2003 for the inter-county competition.In a Twenty20 game,<br>
     the two teams have a single innings each, which is restricted to a maximum of twenty overs.<br>
      Together with first-class and List A cricket, Twenty20 is one of the three forms of cricket recognised by the<br>
       International Cricket Council (ICC) as being played at the highest level, both internationally and domestically.

    A typical Twenty20 game is completed in about three and a half hours, with each innings lasting around 90 minutes and <br>
    an official 10-minute break between the innings. This is much shorter than previous forms of the game, and is closer to the timespan <br>
    of other popular team sports. It was introduced to create a fast-paced game that would be attractive to spectators at the ground<br>
     and viewers on television.
    
    The game has succeeded in spreading around the cricket world. On most international tours there is at least one Twenty20 match<br>
     and all Test-playing nations have a domestic cup competition.</p>
